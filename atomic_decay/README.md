# Atomic Decay

It is an old exercise a had to do for college, so I got the idea and reimplemented on python.

The idea is to create a matrix of 'radioactive atoms' that have a chance to decay after a cycle. So, increasing the amount of atoms, the number of cycles needed to all decay will increase (no matter how big is the atom's chance to decay).

I like this idea because it remembers me how luck works... If something good happens (like a atom that took many cycles to decay even with a great change to do so) this doesn't mean that the atom had "luck", it only means that if the matrix have many atoms some of them will certainly take a lot of cycles to decay, no matter how luck they are.
